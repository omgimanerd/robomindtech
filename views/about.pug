    | Context and immersion greatly enrich the learning experience. Being
    | able to hold a model in your hands, being able to observe exactly
    | how the gears mesh and the linkages move, being able to change that
    | machine in order to produce a desired behavior - in our experience,
    | this is a very effective way to introduce and communicate concepts
    | which are commonly presented to much older students in an abstract
    | mathematical way. After all, understanding conservation of energy
    | does not necessarily involve balancing equations.

    | In our workshops, children create machines and robots from the
    | ground up. Experienced instructors explain the how and why every
    | step of the way, always being careful to relate the day's project
    | back to a real-world concept the children can connect to. After a
    | core build is completed, children are asked to put on their
    | "engineering hats" - they are given time to explore the model's
    | basic functionality, and then they are tasked with a design
    | challenge that asks them to integrate prior knowledge with the
    | novel mechanisms that they themselves built from scratch.

    | The most rewarding result of our work is watching passion and life
    | skills bloom in our students as they grow up to be great and
    | capable leaders. Whether it be presenting at Maker Faire, competing
    | in the World Robot Olympiad, or playing robot rock, paper, scissors
    | at a senior day care, there are many opportunities for all our
    | students. Always open to dialogue about futures, education, careers
    | and experiences, we are passionate about enabling and inspiring
    | youth!
